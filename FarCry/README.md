# Mod for Far Cry

This is a mod for [Far Cry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Cry_%28video_game%29) that attemps to make the game more realistic and *much more difficult*. I recommend that you play this mod with the hardest difficulty level for added challenge. The game is beatable (I have done it), but be prepared to spend much time dying and loading saved games!

The mod features the following changes:

* Weapon damages are significantly increased
* Weapon accuracy is significantly increased
* Damage multipliers for body parts (head, heart, etc) are increased
* Damage multipliers are same for Player-to-AI and AI-to-Player (AI had no bonus for headshots by default)
* Reduced or removed distance-based damage reduction for bullets
* Removed tracer rounds
* Removed view shake
* Reduced crosshair sway when zoomed

The jungle is waiting. Are you ready for the ultimate challenge?

# OpenTTD: Logic Signals

This patch adds logic signals to [OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org/). I created this in 2013.

Logic signals can use other signals as inputs and then set their state (green or red) using simple boolean logic.

There is also a [thread on Transport Tycoon Forums](https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=1093415) for discussion.
